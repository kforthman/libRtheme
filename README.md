# libRtheme

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kforthman/libRtheme")
library(libRtheme)
display.libr.all()
```

This package makes it easy to grab color themes inspired by the LIBR logo. It also makes available the font "Poppins", one of the fonts used on the LIBR website, which can be added to your plot using the argument `family = "Poppins"`.

Logos can be found in eps, pdf, and png format in the folder 'logos'.

Enjoy! Suggestions welcome, please add an issue or email me at kforthman@laureateinstitute.org.
